# context-engineering-for-creative-generation
I created this project to explore the tangible differences between prompt engineering and context engineering in generating AI-driven image and video assets. Through hands-on experimentation, I demonstrate how context-aware approaches consistently produce more relevant, creative, and high-quality outputs compared to traditional prompt engineering.
